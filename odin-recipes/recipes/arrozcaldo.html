  <h1>Chicken Arroz Caldo (Chicken Rice Porridge)
  </h1>
  <p>This ginataang manok is a Filipino chicken dish flavored with ginger and coconut milk. Each family has their own version; this is my mother's. It's a rich dish that makes your kitchen smell so wonderful! Once my family smells the ginger frying and coconut milk simmering, they can't wait for it to be done so they can dig in. I salt it liberally, as the coconut milk tends to hide the salt flavor.</p>
