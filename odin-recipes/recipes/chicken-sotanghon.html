  <h1>Chicken Sotanghon</h1>
  <p>This ginataang manok is a Filipino chicken dish flavored with ginger and coconut milk. Each family has their own version; this is my mother's. It's a rich dish that makes your kitchen smell so wonderful! Once my family smells the ginger frying and coconut milk simmering, they can't wait for it to be done so they can dig in. I salt it liberally, as the coconut milk tends to hide the salt flavor.</p>

        <p class="steps"><strong>Step 1</strong></p>
        <p class="steps-desc">Bring water and 1 teaspoon salt to a boil in a large pot. Add chicken legs and simmer until no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, about 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Reserving the liquid, remove chicken and allow to cool, then remove meat from the bones and shred with two forks. Discard the skin and bones.</p>

        <p class="steps"><strong>Step 2</strong></p>
        <p class="steps-desc">Meanwhile, place shiitake mushrooms in a bowl and pour enough warm water over them to cover completely; allow to soak until pliable, about 30 minutes. Remove mushrooms, reserving water; slice, and set aside. Place noodles in reserved water, adding more warm water if needed to cover; allow to soak until soft, about 10 minutes. Drain and cut noodles if desired.</p>
